 Based on OpenZeppelin's ERC-20 template (https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts), licensed under MIT.

 ## Learning Journey
 As a passionate beginner in Web3, Iâ€™m excited to dive into Solidity and Ethereum. I thoroughly read the OpenZeppelin code, customized the token name and symbol to reflect my learning for ETHGlobal, and deployed it to gain hands-on experience.

 ## Usage
 1. Deploy using Remix IDE or Hardhat.
 2. Interact via MetaMask or ethers.js for token transfers.
